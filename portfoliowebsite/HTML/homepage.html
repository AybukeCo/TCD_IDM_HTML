        <div class="text0">
            <p>I'm a professional with a background in Economics and Business and a Masters degree in Interactive Digital Media from Trinity College Dublin.
            My career journey has taken me through roles as an equity researcher, investor relations specialist, market researcher, and project manager, giving me a well-rounded skill set that bridges both analytical and creative domains.
            I'm skilled in C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Unreal Engine 5, 3DS Max, and Adobe Illustrator, and I've enjoyed working on projects ranging from App or Web design and development to video game design and development.
            I'm passionate about sustainability and the green economy, and I'm driven to create impactful, environmentally-conscious solutions through my work.
            Outside of my professional interests, I love jazz music and express that by singing and playing the tenor saxophone. For more information please visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aybuke-colak-56537b13a"> my LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
