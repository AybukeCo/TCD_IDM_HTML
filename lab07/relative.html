			<p> This page is for playing with the different values of the position property:</p>
		</div>

		<div class="staticexample"> 
			<p> static is the default value.  An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned. </p> 
		</div>

		<div class="relativeexample1">
		<p>relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.<p>
		</div>

		<div class="relativeexample2">
		<p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
		</div>
