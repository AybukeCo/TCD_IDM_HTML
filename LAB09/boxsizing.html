		The original box model behavior was eventually considered unintuitive, so a new CSS property called box-sizing was created. When you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width. Here is the same example as the previous page, but with box-sizing: border-box; on both elements:
		</div>
		
		<div class="fancy">
		And I'm bigger... Or not?
		</div>
